    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**random matrix theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_matrix) means the study of the statistical properties of eigenvalues of very large matrices. Its main goal is to provide understanding of the diverse properties (most notably, **statistics of matrix eigenvalues**) of matrices with entries drawn randomly from various probability distributions traditionally referred to as the random matrix ensembles. The numerical methods used for eigenvalues computation are the **QR** method and **Power methods (direct and indirect)**. The QR method is a numerical stable algorithm and Power method is an iterative one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random matrix theory has found many applications in physics, statistics and engineering since its inception. Although early developments were motivated by practical experimental problems, random matrices are now used in fields as diverse as **Riemann hypothesis**, **stochastic differential equations**, condensed matter physics, statistical physics, **chaotic systems**, many body systems, **quantum chaos**, disordered systems, quantum chromodynamics, **numerical linear algebra**, **neural networks**, multivariate statistics, [**information theory**](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02710326), **signal processing** and **small-world networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Real eigenvalues:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + **GOE, GUE and GSE**: composed respectively of real symmetric, complex Hermitian and complex self-adjoint quaternion matrices with independent, normally distributed mean-zero entries whose variances are adjusted to ensure the invariance of their joint probability density with respect to Orthogonal (respectively, Unitary or Symplectic) similarity transformations. Such invariance is also shared by the corresponding Lebesgue measures.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    + **Invariant non-Gaussian Ensembles (Girko)**: keeps the requirement of invariance of the joint probability density of all entries but relaxes the property of entries being independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Complex eigenvalues:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + **Circular Ensembles (COE, CUE and CSE)**: composed of complex unitary matrices sharing the same invariance properties of the measure as their Gaussian counterparts, but with eigenvalues confined to the unit circle in the complex plane rather than to the real line.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    + **Ginibre Ensemble**: matrices with independent, identically and normally distributed real, complex, or quaternion real entries, and no further constraints imposed."
